                  <h3>Global Privacy Statement</h3>
                  <p><strong>Last Updated: December 8, 2021</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Introduction and overview</strong></p>
                  <p>V3iT leverages technology responsibly to power prosperity around the world, and we believe that everyone has a right to privacy. At V3iT, we view privacy as a key part of the value that we deliver to our customers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vsurve.com/datastewardship.html" target="_blank">V3iT&#39;s Data Stewardship Principles</a>&nbsp;were developed to describe V3iT&rsquo;s values regarding the data our customers entrust to us.</p>

                  <p><strong>Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role</strong></p>

                  <p>
                    As a financial services and technology company, we&rsquo;re providing this Global Privacy Statement (which we&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;Privacy Statement&rdquo;) to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences. This Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all websites and offerings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.v3it.com" target="_blank">V3iT group companies</a>,
                    and it describes our privacy practices when we process:
                  </p>

                  <p>a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing time sheets, rendering professional services in forms of projects and tickets;</p>

                  <p>b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the VSURVE platform, which is collectively, all of V3iT&rsquo;s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) by V3iT Consulting, Inc.. and its affiliates and subsidiaries; and/or</p>

                  <p>c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run and improve our business.</p>

                  <p>
                    V3iT Consulting, Inc. determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information (&ldquo;Information Controller&rdquo;). V3iT Consulting, Inc. may share your personal data with other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.v3it.com" target="_blank">V3iT group companies</a> to process as joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, please contact us in the section &ldquo;How to
                    Contact Us&rdquo; below.
                  </p>

                  <p>This Privacy Statement does not apply where V3iT processes personal information as a service provider on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the Information Controller, for example, the customers of our professional services products. When we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant Information Controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of personal information.</p>

                  <p>
                    In certain circumstances, there may be more than one Information Controller processing your information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as an Information Controller. In these situations, we act as an independent Information Controller over our processing activities &ndash; meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other Information Controller. The other Information
                    Controller may have their own obligations under applicable information privacy law, and you may need to speak with the other Information Controller directly for questions on how they process your personal information.
                  </p>

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p><strong>The VSURVE Platform</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>The VSURVE Platform and your information</strong></p>

                  <p>When we say &ldquo;platform&rdquo; we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), we use that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you&rsquo;re using. This means your project, ticket and time details from VSURVE.</p>

                  <p>The personal information we use in this centralized way is all the information that V3iT knows about you. It includes your credentials; your name and contact details; payment information; information about your activities, your interests and preferences; insights about your finances or your business; the content you place in our Platform; and information we have collected about you from third-party sources.</p>

                  <p><strong>Organizational account information</strong></p>

                  <p>
                    Some experiences and services within the VSURVE Platform allow you to interact with an organization (such as your employer). If you are granted access to an organization or household account (for example, a business&#39;s account in VSURVE), the owner of the project organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about
                    your time, tickets and projects approval); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.
                  </p>

                  <p>Your use of the VSURVE Platform as part of an organization&rsquo;s account may be subject to the organization&rsquo;s policies, which may be different from this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization&#39;s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.</p>

                  <p><strong>Information we collect</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Information we receive from you</strong></p>

                  <p>The personal information that we receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with V3iT, how you configure your account and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings. Personal information that you provide may also depend upon what services or experiences you use, your location and applicable law.&nbsp;Learn more about the personal information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creating an account.</strong>&nbsp;We collect information when you create an account, interact with the VSURVE Platform or activate a subscription. Personal information may include your contact information (such as your name, address, phone number and email), profile photo, billing information (your payment information), usernames and credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identification information.</strong>&nbsp;We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, social security number, social insurance number, driver&rsquo;s license numbers, government-issued identification details, for example to verify your identity in order to help you file your tax return.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer support, product research, training and feedback.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect personal information when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, product research or training and you choose to share.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social and community content.</strong>&nbsp;We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device information.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about your device such as Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers or vendors or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-party service content.</strong>&nbsp;We receive information about you when you sign into a third-party service with your account or when you connect your account to a third-party service. For example, you may choose to connect your account with your bank accounts. To sync your financial account information, we must access your financial account information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage information.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect usage information such as the pages you viewed, the features you use, your browser type and details about any links with which you interact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location information.</strong>&nbsp;Certain features in the VSURVE Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you grant permission to do so in your device settings. For example, if you use our time-tracking service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert advice.</strong>&nbsp;The VSURVE Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts and the guidance provided to you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera and contacts.</strong>&nbsp;Certain features may have access to your camera and contacts if you grant permission in your device settings.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Information from cookies and other technologies.</strong>&nbsp;V3iT and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively &quot;cookies&quot;) to collect information about you (&ldquo;Cookie Information&rdquo;) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers&#39; experience. You have
                      control over some of the information we collect from Cookies and how we use it.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Information stored locally.</strong>&nbsp;Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Biometric Information</strong></p>

                  <p>Certain parts of the VSURVE Platform make use of biometric personal information (&ldquo;Biometric Information&ldquo;). Biometric Information can be subject to additional laws and regulations.</p>

                  <p>
                    We collect Biometric Information from you when you enroll in our biometric identity program and automatically as part of our anti-fraud protection, authentication and customer support activities. These identifiers may include facial recognition information, voiceprints and key-stroke information, as well as mathematical representations of your biometric identifier, such as the template maintained for comparison. We use Biometric Information to identify and authenticate you,
                    and for security and similar purposes. We share Biometric Information with third-party service providers who assist with our information technology, security and fraud programs, our professional advisors, and as required by law or regulation. V3iT does not sell your Biometric Information.
                  </p>

                  <p>When we collect Biometric Information, you will receive a specific notice and consent request at the time of that collection. You are not required to consent to the collection of Biometric Information in order to use our services, although some functionality may not be available if you decline and you may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

                  <p>V3iT will retain Biometric Information until the purposes for which it was collected have been satisfied or three years from your or your organizational account manager&rsquo;s last interaction with V3iT, whichever comes first.</p>

                  <p><strong>Information provided by others</strong></p>

                  <p>
                    Our platform is designed to help you connect with other people and organizations. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input information about you. For example, your employer may input information about your salary and work activity in order to process their payroll. You may also be able to input or process information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator. If you input information about others into our platform, you must only do
                    so if you have first received the appropriate rights and permissions to do so, including by getting advanced written consent, if required by applicable law.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Other information sources</strong></p>

                  <p>We may also get information about you from others where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process information obtained from those parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the VSURVE Platform. For example, we receive information from:</p>

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your service providers.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to sync a non-V3iT account/service with your account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. For example, if you connect a point of sale application to your account, we may receive details of your business&rsquo;s sales records.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Supplemental information and identity verification providers.</strong>&nbsp;Service providers who help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business and/or supplement the information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your information. For example, we use third-party service providers to validate your mailing address, phone number or provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial
                      institution, telecommunications provider or email provider.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support providers.</strong>&nbsp;Service providers who provide us with information about you or your interaction with the VSURVE Platform for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain support information or technical issues you have raised with these third parties.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Credit bureaus and other third parties.</strong>&nbsp;Many of our features rely on information about you that we receive from third parties. For example, in some countries we may offer free credit reports and credit scores we request on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. Our partners may also provide information such as employment or income data, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers
                      available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized recommendations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Other users.</strong>&nbsp;As described above, we may get information about you from other users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, your spouse, your head of household or your employer. We may also collect such information through features like member referral programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk management, cybersecurity &amp; anti-fraud providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive information from service providers who help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud, illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive information from software providers that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication providers &amp; social networks.</strong>&nbsp;If you give us permission, we may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Joint offering partners.</strong>&nbsp;We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Publicly-available sources.</strong>&nbsp;We collect information from publicly available sources, such as open government databases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Government agencies.</strong>&nbsp;We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Required information.</strong>&nbsp;Some services and experiences in the VSURVE Platform require you to provide information for it to function. If you do not wish to provide the required information, you may not be able to use certain features.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Automated Processing</strong></p>

                  <p>To provide you with valuable personalized advice, recommendations and experiences, we may process your personal information using automated and manual (human) methods. Our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI) and a range of technologies that help our services learn and reason to improve our ability to personalize and enhance your experience in the VSURVE Platform.</p>

                  <p><strong>How we share your information</strong></p>

                  <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>

                  <p><strong>With your consent.</strong>&nbsp;In accordance with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vsurve.com/datastewardship.html" target="_blank">Data Stewardship Principles</a>, except for as outlined below, we only share your information with third parties when you have directed us to do so.</p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>When you connect with an VSURVE Platform partner.</strong>&nbsp;You may be provided with offers, products, and services from third-party companies who integrate with our VSURVE Platform (&ldquo;Platform Partner&rdquo;). If you choose to interact with a Platform Partner, apply for their services or offerings or otherwise link or sync your account to a Platform Partner&rsquo;s product or service, you consent and direct V3iT to share your information, including
                    personal information, to the Platform Partner providing the service or offering. For example, when we send your personal information to partners in order to generate offers for you to review, when we send your application information directly to our partners, or when we send you to the partner&rsquo;s site for you to provide the information directly to them.
                  </p>

                  <p>In some cases, if you click through to go to a Platform Partner&rsquo;s site, you will automatically be sending your personal information to that Platform Partner. When this happens, you will still have to submit your application on the Platform Partner&rsquo;s site.
